The materials for the courses, that are publicly available, consist of several types: 

* Notes for the course.
* Slides for the course.
* R programs, ready to use, which contain all data and R code for the all examples and illustrations discussed in the course.
* Online and YouTube tutorials.

# Available courses:

The courses are organized in three clusters.  
 
* The **Introductory courses** that aim to train users in data analysis **using R**  at a basic level. These courses were developed for undergraduate students, both      non statisticians and statisticians.. The courses within this cluster can also be used as courses to support R usage in undergraduate program in (bio)statistic. 
* The cluster **Basic courses** provides courses  at intermediate level and a basic knowledge in statistics is required  in order to follow the courses. The courses 
   within this cluster can be also use as training courses  for non-statisticians and as courses to support R usage in under graduate program in       
   biostatistic/statistics. 
* The cluster **Advanced courses** consista of basic and advanced courses at a master level in (bio)statistics.
